				<h1>About Visualizing Peace</h1>

				<p>
				Lucy Havens and Mengting Bao created the Visualizing Peace website for
				the Political Settlements Research Programme (PSRP) at the University
				of Edinburgh from May through August 2018.  The website's
				visualizations use data from PSRP's Peace Agreements Database (PA-X).
				PA-X provides those studying and participating in peace processes with
				a repository of over 1,500 documents that address over 140 peace
				processes around the world, from the years 1900 through 2015.
				<br/><br/>
				PSRP commissioned Havens and Bao to create an exploratory interface
				to PA-X that complements the <a href="https://www.peaceagreements.org/search">
				Database's search interface</a>.  Visualizing Peace provides a map
				and timelines that illustrate temporal, geographic, and categorical
				trends in peace agreements.  You can filter the map and timelines
				by time, location, and category.  Hovering and clicking on an
				agreement in any of the visualizations displays the agreement's
				details in the left sidebar, with links to a digitized version of
				the document and its complete PA-X coding.
				<br/><br/>
				When visiting the Visualizing Peace website, please use Firefox,
				Chrome, or Safari from a laptop or desktop computer (the data
				visualizations are incompatible with tablets and mobile devices).
				</p>


				<h1>How To Use <em>Visualizing Peace</em></h1>

				<p>
				With Visualizing Peace, you can view peace agreements across three
				dimensions: time, geography, and category.  At the top of the webpage,
				<em>Agreements in Time and Space</em> visualizes agreements on a
				timeline and a map simultaneously.  At the bottom of the webpage,
				<em>Agreement Sequence Comparison</em> visualizes agreements on three
				timelines, with one geographic location represented on each timeline.
				To understand the codes assigned to each peace agreement as
				represented in the data visualizations, please visit
				<a href="https://github.com/thegoose20/pax/wiki/Understanding-PA-X-Codes">
				Understanding PA-X Codes</a>.  To download the complete PA-X Codebook,
				please

				click here</a>.

				<h3>Reading and Filtering <em>Agreements in Time and Space</em></h3>

				<!-- INSERT GRAPHICAL EXPLANATION -->
				<p>
					On the timeline running horizontally across the top of the webpage,
					black lines represent peace agreements.  You can select a start year,
					an end year, locations ("countries/entities"), and categories
					("codes") to control which peace agreements the timeline and map
					display.
					On the map, flower-like graphics represent peace agreements,
					with petals indicating how much detail the agreement contains about
					codes in the left sidebar.  The larger the petal, the more detail the
					agreement has about the code associated with that petal's color.
					The absence of a petal means the agreement does not address the
					associated code at all.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are four timeline views that arrange the peace agreements
					differently:
				</p>
				<!-- INSERT GRAPHICAL EXPLANATION -->
				<ol>
					<li>
						(1) <b>Chronology</b> arranges peace agreements by the
						date on which they were signed.  If there are multiple agreements
						signed on the same day, then the height of the lines representing
						agreements will shrink so the lines can be stacked on top of one
						another.  Hovering or clicking a line displays the represented
						agreement's details in the left sidebar.  When you click an
						agreement, the corresponding agreement on the map (represented as
						a flower-like graphic) grows in size.
					</li>
					<!-- INSERT GRAPHICAL EXPLANATION -->
					<li>
						(2) <b>Count per Day</b> also arranges peace agreements by the
						date on which they were signed.  Unlike the Chronology view, though,
						each line in Count per Day represents the total number of agreements
						signed on that day (so this view can be read as a bar chart).
						Hovering over a line displays a tooltip with the total number and
						date.
					</li>
					<!-- INSERT GRAPHICAL EXPLANATION -->
					<li>
						(3) <b>Yearly with Counts</b> arranges peace agreements by the
						year in which they were signed.  The agreements are stacked
						chronologically from top to bottom (e.g. January at the top, December
						at the bottom).  The number at the top of each yearly stack indicates
						the total number of agreements signed in that year.
						Hovering or clicking a line displays the represented agreement's
						details in the left sidebar.  When you click an agreement, the
						corresponding agreement on the map (represented as a flower-like
						graphic) grows in size.
					</li>
					<!-- INSERT GRAPHICAL EXPLANATION -->
					<li>
						(4) <b>Yearly with Code Proportions</b> also arranges peace
						agreements by the year in which they were signed, stacking the
						agreements chronologically from top to bottom.  Agreements that
						address codes you've selected in the left sidebar will appear as
						black lines (other agreements will appear as dark gray lines).  The
						percentage at the top of each yearly stack indicates the proportion
						of agreements that address your code selections for that year.
						Hovering or clicking a black line displays the represented agreement's
						details in the left sidebar.  When you click an agreement, the
						corresponding agreement on the map (represented as a flower-like
						graphic) grows in size.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Reading and Filtering <em>Agreement Sequence Comparison</em></h3>
				<!-- INSERT GRAPHICAL EXPLANATION -->
				<p>
					On the timelines running vertically at the bottom of the webpage,
					rectangles represent peace agreements.  You can select one location
					("countries/entities") for each vertical timeline, and categories
					("codes") to control which peace agreements the timeline and map
					display.  The color of each rectangle indicates the type of agreement
					(based on the stage of the associated conflict) represented.  Hovering
					or clicking a rectangle displays the represented agreement's details
					in the left sidebar.  When you click an agreement on one vertical
					timeline, any rectangles representing that same agreement on the
					other other vertical timelines will be highlighted.
