				<p>
					The 'Time and Space' visualisation was originally developed by Lucy
					Havens and Mengting Bao in the summer of 2018, and updated by Sarah
					Sch√∂ttler in early 2019.
				</p>

				<p>
					This visualisation provides a map and timelines that illustrate
					temporal, geographic, and categorical trends in peace agreements. The
					map and timelines can be filtered by time, location, and category.
					Hovering and clicking on an agreement in any of the visualizations
					displays the agreement's details, with links to a digitized version of
					the document and its complete PA-X coding.
				</p>

				<h3>How to read the visualisations</h3>
				<p>
					With this visualisation, you can view peace agreements across three
					dimensions: time, geography, and category. <br />
					There are options for filtering displayed on the left, which allow you
					to view a subset of the data, e.g. a particular timeframe, specific
					countries or entities, or agreements with certain codes (categories)
					assigned.<br />
					To understand the codes assigned to each peace agreement as
					represented in the data visualizations, please refer to the
					<a
						href="http://www.peaceagreements.org/files/PA_X_codebook_Version1_Feb_20_20.pdf"
						>PA-X Codebook</a
					>.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Agreements in Time and Space</b> visualizes agreements on a
					timeline and a map simultaneously.<br />
					On the map, dots represent peace agreements. Clicking a country will
					open a new view showing all peace agreements signed by that country,
					sorted on a spiral. Each agreement is represented by a flower-like
					symbol. The larger a petal, the more detail the agreement has about
					the code associated with that petal's color. The absence of a petal
					means the agreement does not address the associated code at all. If an
					agreement does not address any of the codes, it is displayed as a grey
					dot.
				</p>
