      <h1>How To Use <em>Visualizing Peace</em></h1>

          <p>
            With Visualizing Peace, you can view peace agreements across three
            dimensions: time, geography, and category.  At the top of the webpage,
            <em>Agreements in Time and Space</em> visualizes agreements on a
            timeline and a map simultaneously.  At the bottom of the webpage,
            <em>Agreement Sequence Comparison</em> visualizes agreements on three
            timelines, with one geographic location represented on each timeline.
            To understand the codes assigned to each peace agreement as
            represented in the data visualizations, please visit
            <a href="https://github.com/thegoose20/pax/wiki/Understanding-PA-X-Codes">
            Understanding PA-X Codes</a>.  To download the complete PA-X Codebook,
            please

          </p>
          <p>
            When visiting the Visualizing Peace website, please use Firefox,
            Chrome, or Safari from a laptop or desktop computer (the data
            visualizations are incompatible with tablets and mobile devices).
          </p>

          <h3>Reading and Filtering <em>Agreements in Time and Space</em></h3>

          <!-- INSERT GRAPHICAL EXPLANATION -->
          <p>
            On the timeline running horizontally across the top of the webpage,
            black lines represent peace agreements.  You can select a start year,
            an end year, locations ("countries/entities"), and categories
            ("codes") to control which peace agreements the timeline and map
            display.
            On the map, flower-like graphics represent peace agreements,
            with petals indicating how much detail the agreement contains about
            codes in the left sidebar.  The larger the petal, the more detail the
            agreement has about the code associated with that petal's color.
            The absence of a petal means the agreement does not address the
            associated code at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are four timeline views that arrange the peace agreements
            differently:
          </p>
            <!-- INSERT GRAPHICAL EXPLANATION -->
              <ol>
                <li>
                  (1) <b>Chronology</b> arranges peace agreements by the
                  date on which they were signed.  If there are multiple agreements
                  signed on the same day, then the height of the lines representing
                  agreements will shrink so the lines can be stacked on top of one
                  another.  Hovering or clicking a line displays the represented
                  agreement's details in the left sidebar.  When you click an
                  agreement, the corresponding agreement on the map (represented as
                  a flower-like graphic) grows in size.
                </li>
                <!-- INSERT GRAPHICAL EXPLANATION -->
                <li>
                  (2) <b>Count per Day</b> also arranges peace agreements by the
                  date on which they were signed.  Unlike the Chronology view, though,
                  each line in Count per Day represents the total number of agreements
                  signed on that day (so this view can be read as a bar chart).
                  Hovering over a line displays a tooltip with the total number and
                  date.
                </li>
                <!-- INSERT GRAPHICAL EXPLANATION -->
                <li>
                  (3) <b>Yearly with Counts</b> arranges peace agreements by the
                  year in which they were signed.  The agreements are stacked
                  chronologically from top to bottom (e.g. January at the top, December
                  at the bottom).  The number at the top of each yearly stack indicates
                  the total number of agreements signed in that year.
                  Hovering or clicking a line displays the represented agreement's
                  details in the left sidebar.  When you click an agreement, the
                  corresponding agreement on the map (represented as a flower-like
                  graphic) grows in size.
                </li>
                <!-- INSERT GRAPHICAL EXPLANATION -->
                <li>
                  (4) <b>Yearly with Code Proportions</b> also arranges peace
                  agreements by the year in which they were signed, stacking the
                  agreements chronologically from top to bottom.  Agreements that
                  address codes you've selected in the left sidebar will appear as
                  black lines (other agreements will appear as dark gray lines).  The
                  percentage at the top of each yearly stack indicates the proportion
                  of agreements that address your code selections for that year.
                  Hovering or clicking a black line displays the represented agreement's
                  details in the left sidebar.  When you click an agreement, the
                  corresponding agreement on the map (represented as a flower-like
                  graphic) grows in size.
                </li>
              </ol>

          <h3>Reading and Filtering <em>Agreement Sequence Comparison</em></h3>
          <!-- INSERT GRAPHICAL EXPLANATION -->
          <p>
            On the timelines running vertically at the bottom of the webpage,
            rectangles represent peace agreements.  You can select one location
            ("countries/entities") for each vertical timeline, and categories
            ("codes") to control which peace agreements the timeline and map
            display.  The color of each rectangle indicates the type of agreement
            (based on the stage of the associated conflict) represented.  Hovering
            or clicking a rectangle displays the represented agreement's details
            in the left sidebar.  When you click an agreement on one vertical
            timeline, any rectangles representing that same agreement on the
            other other vertical timelines will be highlighted.
