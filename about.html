            Lucy Havens and Mengting Bao created the Visualizing Peace website for
            the Political Settlements Research Programme (PSRP) at the University
            of Edinburgh from May through August 2018.  The website's
            visualizations use data from PSRP's Peace Agreements Database (PA-X).
            PA-X provides those studying and participating in peace processes with
            a repository of over 1,500 documents that address over 140 peace
            processes around the world, from the years 1900 through 2015.

          <br/><br/>
            PSRP commissioned Havens and Bao to create an exploratory interface
            to PA-X that complements the <a href="https://www.peaceagreements.org/search">
            Database's search interface</a>.  Visualizing Peace provides interactive
            maps and timelines that illustrate temporal, geographic, and categorical
            trends in peace agreements.  You can filter the maps and timelines
            by time, location, and category.  Hovering and clicking on an
            agreement in any of the visualizations displays the agreement's
            details in the left sidebar, with links to a digitized version of
            the document and its complete PA-X coding.
          <br/><br/>
            When visiting the Visualizing Peace website, please use Firefox,
            Chrome, or Safari from a laptop or desktop computer (the data
            visualizations are incompatible with tablets and mobile devices).
