P. Sharma Oli, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal, with regard to the peace process in Nepal and the request for United Nations assistance in that process (see annexes I-III).
I am pleased to report that peace talks between the Seven Party Alliance forming the Government of Nepal and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) led to the successful conclusion of an important agreement on 8 November 2006, which has now been  consolidated  by  a  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement,  signed  on 21 November 2006. Earlier this year, following receipt of the identical letters of 9 August 2006 from the Government and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), I appointed Ian Martin as my Personal Representative to undertake consultations with all concerned parties in order to build on the common understanding that had emerged. The agreement of 8 November 2006 represents an important milestone outlining the next steps in the political process leading to free and fair elections for a Constituent Assembly in 2007. In that agreement, the parties have agreed on the basic arrangements for the cantonment of the combatants of the Maoist People’s Liberation Army and the storage of the arms and munitions of both sides. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement declares the commitment of the parties to transform the existing ceasefire into permanent peace.

In this context, I am happy to inform you that the United Nations team, which left Kathmandu a week ago, held extensive yet fruitful consultations with all concerned stakeholders of the peace process here in Nepal. The United Nations team, as I understand, is to submit its report to you on Nepal.
In the meantime, I wish to inform you that further to the Eight-Point Understanding between the Seven Party Alliance and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) of 16 June 2006 and the commitment expressed by the Government of Nepal to the Agreement, the Government and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) hereby request the United Nations to provide its assistance as follows with a view to creating a free and fair atmosphere for the election of a Constituent Assembly and the entire peace process:

It is now one year since the Good Friday Agreement was concluded. Last May it was emphatically endorsed by the people, North and South, and as such it now represents their democratic will. The Agreement, in its own words, offers a truly historic opportunity for a new beginning. It gives us a chance, in this generation, to transcend the bitter legacy of the past and to transform relationships within Northern Ireland, between North and South, and between these islands...The implementation in full of the Agreement is inevitably a lengthy and complex process, involving continuing effort and commitment on all our parts.
It is encouraging and important that, even though much remains to be done, very substantial progress has already been made in turning the promise of the Agreement into a reality. We must not forget or underplay how far we have come...

The announcements made by the Irish Republican Army on 31 August 1994 and the Combined Loyalist Military Command on 13 October 1994 are a welcome response to the profound desire of people throughout these islands for a permanent end to the violence which caused such immense suffering and waste and served only to reinforce the barriers of fear and hatred, impeding the search for agreement.

Page 2, 7.
In this Framework Document both Governments therefore describe a shared understanding reached between them on the parameters of a possible outcome to the Talks process, consistent with the Joint Declaration and the statement of 26 March 1991. Through this they hope to give impetus and direction to the process and to show that a fair and honourable accommodation can be envisaged across all the relationships, which would enable people to work constructively for their mutual benefit, without compromising the essential principles or the long-term aspirations or interests of either tradition or of either community.

Page 2, 9.
The primary objective of both Governments in their approach to Northern Ireland is to promote and establish agreement among the people of the island of Ireland, building on the Joint Declaration. To this end they will both deploy their political resources with the aim of securing a new and comprehensive agreement involving the relevant political parties in Northern Ireland and commanding the widest possible support.

Page 2, 9.
They take as guiding principles for their co-operation in search of this agreement: (i) the principle of self-determination, as set out in the Joint Declaration;...

Page 3, 12.
...They will continue to work towards and encourage the achievement of agreement, so as to realise the goal set out in the statement of 26 March 1991 of ""a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands"".

Page 4, Constitutional Issues, 17.
New arrangements should be in accordance with the commitments in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in the Joint Declaration. They should acknowledge that it would be wrong to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland save with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. If in future a majority of the people there wish for and formally consent to the establishment of a united Ireland, the two Governments will introduce and support legislation to give effect to that wish.

Page 5, Constitutional Issues, 20.
...This new approach for Northern Ireland, based on the continuing willingness to accept the will of a majority of the people there, will be enshrined in British constitutional legislation embodying the principles and commitments in the Joint Declaration and this Framework Document, either by amendment of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 or by its replacement by appropriate new legislation, and appropriate new provisions entrenched by agreement.

Page 11, East-West Structures, 42.
...The Conference will be the principal instrument for an intensification of the co-operation and partnership between both Governments, with particular reference to the principles contained in the Joint Declaration, in this Framework Document and in the new Agreement, on a wide range of issues concerned with Northern Ireland and with the
relations between the two parts of the island of Ireland. It will facilitate the promotion of lasting peace, stability, justice and reconciliation among the people of the island of Ireland and maintenance of effective security co-operation between the two Governments.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,3,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,Northern Ireland peace process,68,119.0,315.0,,,,22/02/1995,1995,3,4,8,1,4,0,7,1,1985.0,2005.0,1994.0,1993.0,1990.0,1996.0,1997.0,2000.0,0.0,United Kingdom,0.0,200.0,826.0,UK,GBR,Ireland,205.0,372.0,IRE,IRL,,,1995,2,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

... Whereas in the Oslo Agreement of 30 March 1990, the delegation of the National Reconciliation Commission of Guatemala (CNR), acting with the full support of the Government of Guatemala, and the delegation of the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG), acting with the full support of its General Command, placed on record their express determination to find ways to solve the nation's problems peacefully by political means,
Whereas on 24 April 1991, the process of direct negotiation began between the Government of the Republic of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG), the Parties having pledged that the political agreements reached would reflect the legitimate aspirations of all Guatemalans and would be drawn up in accordance with the constitutional framework in force and with the El Escorial agreements, in which URNG and the country's political parties had pledged to promote such reforms of the Political Constitution of the Republic as were necessary for the reconciliation of all Guatemalans, the ending of the internal armed conflict, the peaceful solution of the nation's problems by political means and full respect for and application of the law,

Page 1, I. CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS
... Whereas the above-mentioned reforms will contribute to political stability, the strengthening of civilian power and the agreed redefinition of the functions of the armed forces for the new era in the country's history which will begin with the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace,

Page 1, I. CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS
... Whereas the above-mentioned reforms also systematize and develop the spirit and the letter of the commitments signed on institutional, political, economic, social and ethnic issues, on human rights and their strict observance and on efforts to combat impunity,

Page 2, A. Constitutional reforms contained in the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples
4. This Agreement provides for constitutional recognition of the identity of the Maya, Garifuna and Xinca peoples and, from that standpoint, of the need to define and characterize the Guatemalan State as being one of national unity and multi-ethnic, multicultural and multilingual in nature. It is not just a matter of recognizing the existence and identity of various ethnic groups, as article 66 of the Constitution currently does, but of recognizing that the very make-up of society, without prejudice to the unity of the nation and the State, is characterized in that way; this also entails recognizing the specific nature of indigenous people's spirituality as an essential component of their world view and of the transmission of their values, and granting official constitutional recognition to indigenous languages as one of the mainstays of national culture and as a vehicle for acquiring and transmitting indigenous people's world view, knowledge and cultural values.

Page 3, A. Constitutional reforms contained in the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Identity of the Maya, Official recognition of indigenous languages
7. Sponsor in the Congress of the Republic, in accordance with the conclusions of the Official Recognition Commission established under the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the necessary constitutional amendments arising out of the Commission's work.

Page 3, B. Constitutional reforms included in the Agreement on the  Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the  Armed Forces in a Democratic Society
10. Within the framework of the modernization of State institutions, the Agreement on the Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the Armed Forces in a Democratic Society provides for constitutional reforms with respect to the Congress of the Republic, the Judiciary, the functions of the President of the Republic, and the Guatemalan armed forces. The aim is not to propose case-by-case measures, but to reformulate the whole conception of State organs and institutions with a view to strengthening democracy in line with present-day constitutional trends.

Page 6, B. Constitutional reforms included in the Agreement on the  Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the  Armed Forces in a Democratic Society, Functions of the President of the Republic
24. With regard to the functions of the President of the Republic, it has been agreed to sponsor the inclusion of the following in article 183:
... ""To order these exceptional measures, the President of the Republic shall issue the corresponding agreement. The action of the armed forces shall be limited to such time and modalities as are strictly necessary and shall cease as soon as its purpose has been achieved. The President of the Republic shall keep the Congress informed of the operations of the armed forces, and the Congress may at any time order that such operations shall cease. In any event, within 15 days following the end of such operations, the President of the Republic shall submit to the Congress a detailed report on the action of the armed forces.""

Page 7-8, II. ELECTORAL REGIME
Whereas:
... The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors, including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans, the capacity of political parties to fulfil people's expectations, the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education, all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen.
... This Agreement seeks to promote legal and institutional reforms which will remedy those shortcomings and constraints and, together with the other peace agreements, help to improve the electoral regime as an instrument of democratic transformation.

Page 8, II. ELECTORAL REGIME, Electoral Reform Commission
3. It is recommended that the above Commission be constituted no later than three months after the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and that it complete its work no later than six months from the date of its establishment. In order to achieve its objectives, the Commission would have to encourage an extensive pluralistic debate on the subject of Guatemala's electoral regime.

Page 11, II. ELECTORAL REGIME, Public information campaigns
19. In order to ensure that these campaigns are effective, account would have to be taken of the importance of using the various languages of indigenous peoples, as agreed in the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Page 11, III. FINAL PROVISIONS

On consideration of various demands of Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) and consequent upon Tripartite Meeting held on 25.7.1988 at New Delhi between the Union Home Minister, Government of West Bengal and Shri Subash Ghisingh, President, GNLF, a Memorandum of Settlement (Darjeeling Accord) was signed on 22.8.1988. Pursuant to another meeting between the Union Home Minister and Shri Subash Ghisingh, President GNLF at New Delhi on 25.7. 1988, a further Memorandum of Settlement was signed on 23.8.1988.

Page 1,
3. Pursuant to the above mentioned Settlement, GNLF agreed to drop the demand for a separate State of Gorkhaland and an autonomous hill council, viz, Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC), was set up under ‘The Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council Act, 1988’ notified by the Government of West Bengal on 15.10.1988. The hill areas under DGHC comprised of the three hill Sub-Divisions of Darjeeling District, viz, Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong and 13 mouzas of Siliguri Sub-Division of that District.

Page 1,
4. However, Shri Subash Ghisingh (former Chairman and Chief Executive Councilor, DGHC, presently Administrator) had been demanding constitutional status for the DGHC as, according to him, the abovementioned Settlements could not fulfill the aspirations of the people of Darjeeling. A series of tripartite meetings were held between Government of India, Government of West Bengal and Shri Subash Ghisingh to review the implementation of Darjeeling Accord and further issues arising from it. As a result of these meetings, it is hereby agreed in principle to create a self-governing body for the Darjeeling hill areas in the State of West Bengal.",2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,Darjeeling peace process,33,,,,,,06/12/2005,2005,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,1,1995.0,2015.0,2004.0,2003.0,2000.0,2006.0,2007.0,2010.0,0.0,India,0.0,750.0,356.0,IND,IND,,,,,,,,2005,6,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
