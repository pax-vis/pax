In recent weeks, a series of bilateral meetings have taken place in an attempt to find solutions to outstanding issues for compliance with the agreements based on the document presented by the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional, FMLN) to the Security Council and Secretary General on 16 July, setting out what are in its opinion 15 priority outstanding points to be implemented by the Government of El Salvador, to which a further four were added.
The review and search for solutions to these points, with which the government explicitly indicated its desire to comply, was bearing fruit. However, in some instances there remains much work to be done, as is the case with the Land Transfer Programme, which has currently only reached around 10% of the planned target. In others, legislative decrees are required and are currently pending approval by the Legislative Assembly, while other points are currently being implemented. Finally, some points have required decisive government action, while others have simply been implemented.
Following this exercise, both parties agreed that points that have already been dealt with and routine matters must not be included in the meeting scheduled with the president. Instead, only those that, not being specifically covered in the agreements and whose solution can deliver progress in the peace and reconciliation process, require a political solution at the presidential level should be included. These points will be dealt with outside the agreements and will be included in Items 7 and 10 for youth veterans.

5. Guarantee the civil nature of PNC and its autonomy with respect to the Armed Forces.
... In the complementary agreements dated 22 December 1992, it was agreed, as expressed in the letters sent regarding the matter by Iqbal Riza, at the time Special Representative of the Secretary General, on 23 December 1992, that military members of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) and UEA were only authorised to enter PNC based on their technical qualifications, subject to permanent separation from the armed forces and only under exceptional circumstances, without setting a precedent.
The current staff and teams of IACHR and UEA will be incorporated into PNC in this way to form the initial core of the criminal and antinarcotics investigation divisions, respectively, incorporated not as whole units, but as individual teams and staff. FMLN reiterates its position that only staff of IACHR and UEA as of 22 December 1992 can be transferred and will be assessed by the Director of PNC with verification by ONUSAL prior to joining, based on criteria of professional competence and aptitude to perform the corresponding role in the new civil police body. Following evaluation, they must also pass the specifically designed ANSP course for the doctrine and other conceptual elements of PNC, as set out in the aforementioned agreements on 22 December.

Page 7, G. FUNDING
15. Achieving the remaining funding
The government is using its own resources to meet the financial requirements derived from the agreements: it has provided SVC 36 million for the operations of ANSP, SVC 176 million for PNC and SVC 40 million for TSE. Financial support from the international community has been less than envisaged and slow in arriving.
The Secretary General of the United Nations will continue to support the government’s efforts to obtain the necessary resources.

As such, it is not deemed necessary to start the infrastructure works for construction of the final ANSP site due to the high cost.

...The meeting comes against a backdrop of non-implementation of key provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), more especially the conduct of free and fair general elections, holding of referendum on self-determination for the people of Southern Sudan to either confirm unity of Sudan or opt for separation and holding of Abyei referendum on whether Abyei retains its special administrative status in the North or be part of Bahr el Ghazal. The meeting also comes as the simmering crisis in Darfur is intensifying. This underscores the need for extensive dialogue without prior conditions or exclusion of any party with a view to addressing the national crisis Sudan currently faces.

Page 3, PREAMBLE
...The aim is to ensure full implementation of all peace agreements and all constitutional arrangements prescribed in the Interim National Constitution (INC), 2005; including respect for human rights and the rule of law, political empowerment of women, conduct of free and fair elections, holding of referendum for the people of Southern Sudan and popular consultation for Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile States. The commitment to resolve the conflict in Darfur is duly emphasized.

3.1.1.2. Enactment of Referendum Bill during the prorogation of the current National Assembly, with simple majority vote (50%+1) being threshold for either confirming unity of Sudan or opting for secession and providing for all Southern Sudanese to take part in this process; and
3.1.1.3. Demarcation of North-South borders prior to the holding of general elections.
3.1.2. Emphasizes the importance of bringing all laws in consonance with the INC, 2005
3.1.5. Adhering to the CPA provisions on making unity attractive, the APPC decides to set up a working group focused on developing political, economic and cultural programs to promote unity during the remainder of the Interim Period while at the same time guaranteeing respect for separation in the event the people of Southern Sudan opt for it.

Page 6, 3.2 DARFUR CONFLICT
3.2.1. Urges the full implementation of Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), particularly the powersharing, wealth-sharing and security provisions.
3.2.9. Calls for the holding of the Darfur-Darfur dialogue conference with the participation of all stakeholders with the view to sorting out Darfuri internal relations and repairing the social fabric destroyed by the civil war. The conference shall be guided by agreed Declaration of Principles (DOP), resulting in comprehensive agreement that shall be acceptable to all Darfurians and endorsed nationally by an all-party conference.

Page 7, 3. PEACE AGREEMENTS, 3.3. Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement (ESPA)
3.3.1. The APPC reaffirms its commitment to full implementation of ESPA and to the lifting of state of emergency.
3.3.2. The APPC further reiterates its commitment to address the shortcomings of ESPA through the undertaking of complementary political, developmental and remedial measures to resolve the underlying grievances of the people of Eastern Sudan.

6.1.1. Ensuring respect for international conventions;

Page 9, 7. THE WAY FORWARD
7.4. The APPC maintains that Juba Declaration shall be subject to periodic review, particularly in relation to democratic transformation, elections, holding of referendum on self-determination for the people of Southern Sudan, implementation of Abyei Protocol and holding of popular consultation for the people of Blue Nile and South Kordofan States, in addition to finding a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in Darfur.

In connection with the renewal of the conflicts between the two armies (the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council) in central Bosnia and some other parts of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which have caused many casualties and serious violations of international humanitarian law, thus posing the threat of far-reaching political consequences, the signatories of this Joint Statement hereby order all military units of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) to immediately cease fire and all hostilities in all areas where such military units are in contact.

Page 1, 3.
The signatories of this Joint Statement urge all commanders and units of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) to unconditionally respect all the thus far concluded agreements between the representatives of the Croatian and Muslim peoples in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In particular, they urge military units of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Croatian Defence Council to immediately start implementing the Agreement on the legality of both the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the HVO, and on the establishment of a joint command of both forces made up of representatives of both headquarters (enclosure).

Page 1-2, 4.
The signatories of the Joint Statement reaffirm that the conflicts between units of the HVO and of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina are contrary to the policy of the representatives of the two peoples, and that the continuation of such conflicts would seriously jeopardize the achievement of their political goals, i.e. the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina within the framework of the Vance-Owen plan accepted and signed by the signatories of this Statement, and success in the fight against the aggressor who wants to break the State apart, occupy its territory and annex the occupied territories to ""Greater Serbia"".",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Bosnia peace process,140,203.0,398.0,,,,25/04/1993,1993,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,7,1983.0,2003.0,1992.0,1991.0,1988.0,1994.0,1995.0,1998.0,0.0,Bosnia-Herzegovina,0.0,346.0,70.0,BOS,BIH,Yugoslavia,345.0,,YUG,,215.0,War of Bosnian Independence,1993,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
