We reiterate our strong commitment to the speedy implementation and full functioning of the Federation and all its institutions. We reaffirm our commitment to the Dayton Agreement on Implementing the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina of 10 November 1995 and to the obligations of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina of 14 December 1995. We confirm our support for the Rome Statement of 18 February 1996, the Geneva Statement of 18 March 1996 and the Sarajevo Agreement on the Federation of 30 March 1996. We commit ourselves to the full and rapid implementation of those provisions of the Sarajevo Agreement that have not yet been fulfilled.

Page 2, 7.
We reiterate our commitment with regard to the provisions of the Peace Agreement that all refugees and displaced persons have the right to return to their homes in the whole territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina with full protection of their human and other rights.

Page 2, Federation implementation, 9.
We reaffirm the commitment under the Rome Statement on Sarajevo of 18 February 1996 that there will be equal treatment and non-discrimination for Bosniacs, Croats, Serbs and Others in Sarajevo. This includes, in line with paragraph 7 above, the right of return for refugees and displaced persons of all peoples that left Sarajevo and the full protection of their human and other rights. It also means that all these peoples will have the opportunity to participate fully in the governance of the city. The Joint Civilian Commission Sarajevo will continue to function, as stipulated in the Rome Statement, as a consultative and coordinating body for this purpose.

Page 4, Media issues, 18.
After consideration of the implementation of previous agreements on the Federation, we stress the importance of realizing the provisions on media contained in the Petersberg Agreement of 10 March 1995. With this in mind, the President and the Vice President of the Federation will submit this issue to the Federation Assembly, with a view to ensuring free access of all citizens and peoples to the public media.

Page 4, Police issues, 19.
We support the Agreement on restructuring the police of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina concluded in Bonn-Petersberg today; we also welcome that the inaugural session of the Police Commission responsible for the implementation of the Agreement took place here today.

Page 4, Police issues, 21.
We welcome the presentation of the newly designed grey Federation police uniforms today in Bonn-Petersberg that will be used by all uniformed police operating throughout the Federation, as has been decided by the Federation Government. This uniform is an important symbol of our commitment to the restructuring of policing in the Federation.

Page 5, Economic issues, 26.
We note that the World Bank supports the building up of key economic institutions of the Federation, as agreed in paragraph 7 of the Sarajevo Agreement on the Federation, i.e.:
- the Federation customs administration is fully operational (all Federation revenue accounts are open, and uninterrupted transfer of customs revenue into these accounts takes place and proper monitoring and control of all international border crossing is assured, in accordance with the Sarajevo Agreement);

In connection with the renewal of the conflicts between the two armies (the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council) in central Bosnia and some other parts of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which have caused many casualties and serious violations of international humanitarian law, thus posing the threat of far-reaching political consequences, the signatories of this Joint Statement hereby order all military units of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) to immediately cease fire and all hostilities in all areas where such military units are in contact.

Page 1, 3.
The signatories of this Joint Statement urge all commanders and units of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) to unconditionally respect all the thus far concluded agreements between the representatives of the Croatian and Muslim peoples in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In particular, they urge military units of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Croatian Defence Council to immediately start implementing the Agreement on the legality of both the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the HVO, and on the establishment of a joint command of both forces made up of representatives of both headquarters (enclosure).

The signatories of the Joint Statement reaffirm that the conflicts between units of the HVO and of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina are contrary to the policy of the representatives of the two peoples, and that the continuation of such conflicts would seriously jeopardize the achievement of their political goals, i.e. the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina within the framework of the Vance-Owen plan accepted and signed by the signatories of this Statement, and success in the fight against the aggressor who wants to break the State apart, occupy its territory and annex the occupied territories to ""Greater Serbia"".",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Bosnia peace process,140,203.0,398.0,,,,25/04/1993,1993,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,7,1983.0,2003.0,1992.0,1991.0,1988.0,1994.0,1995.0,1998.0,0.0,Bosnia-Herzegovina,0.0,346.0,70.0,BOS,BIH,Yugoslavia,345.0,,YUG,,215.0,War of Bosnian Independence,1993,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
